# WeWork Public Plugins

General-purpose Codex plugins maintained for Wework and distributed through
the public plugin marketplace.

## Repository layout

```text
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json   # local marketplace registry
plugins/<name>/                    # one plugin per directory
  .codex-plugin/plugin.json        # required manifest
  skills/ commands/ scripts/ ...   # optional plugin surfaces
```

## Available plugins

- `dingtalk`: DingTalk collaboration through the local DWS CLI.
- `documents`: Create, inspect, edit, render, and validate DOCX files.
- `lark`: Feishu/Lark collaboration through the official local CLI.
- `pdf`: Create, inspect, transform, render, and validate PDF files.
- `presentations`: Create, inspect, edit, render, and validate PPTX decks.
- `product-design`: Product design exploration, audits, and interactive prototyping.
- `spreadsheets`: Create, inspect, edit, render, and validate XLSX workbooks.
- `wecom`: WeCom collaboration through the official local CLI.

## Local artifact runtime

The document, PDF, presentation, and spreadsheet plugins prefer compatible Python packages supplied by the host workspace runtime. If the required packages are unavailable, each plugin creates a versioned environment under `~/.wegent-executor/plugin-envs/wework-public/` from a hash-locked requirements file. The bootstrap never modifies system Python or the shared runtime. A first-time isolated installation requires Python 3.10 or newer with `venv` support and access to a Python package index.

LibreOffice and Poppler are optional host-provided native tools used for PDF conversion and page rendering. Creation, inspection, editing, and structural validation do not mutate those tools.

## Windows compatibility

All eight plugins are covered by repository-level Windows compatibility tests.
DingTalk, Lark, and WeCom ship PowerShell launchers that preserve native exit
codes even when Windows PowerShell 5.1 converts normal CLI stderr into error
records. Python-based skills document the Windows `py -3` launcher, and
reference commands avoid hard-coded POSIX temporary paths and heredocs.

Run the cross-plugin compatibility suite with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The `Windows compatibility` GitHub Actions workflow additionally parses every
PowerShell script and runs the native Windows authorization/exit-code tests on
`windows-latest`.

## DingTalk builds

DingTalk 0.3.1 declares its build in `plugins/dingtalk/.wework-build.json` and keeps
all canonical SDK inputs inside `.wework-build/` in that plugin directory.
GitHub-to-internal-repository mirroring therefore retains everything needed by
the existing MR, package, test and automatic-release pipeline. No separate
account-authentication edition or manual artifact selection is needed.

```bash
uv run --no-project --python 3.12 python plugins/dingtalk/.wework-build/dws-auth/vendor.py --check .
uv run --no-project --python 3.12 python plugins/dingtalk/.wework-build/dws-auth/package.py --plugin plugins/dingtalk --output .ci-artifacts/dingtalk-account-auth.zip
```

Maintain generated inputs in Wegent and refresh them with `sdk/dws-auth/vendor.py`.
The builder prepares pinned Go tools, preserves reviewed source, builds five native
targets and exercises the private adapter. The ordinary official publishing command
automatically runs this build; GitLab tests and releases the same resulting ZIP.
The GitHub workflow remains an additional cross-platform build check.

## Adding a plugin

1. Create `plugins/<slug>/` with a valid `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
2. Keep credentials and user-specific state outside the repository.
3. Register the plugin in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.
4. Validate the manifest and every bundled skill before submitting changes.
